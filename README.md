Utility files for me to function seamlessly.

## Notes to self:
* Install `awesome-vim` basic files from amix's repo
* Install Vundle
* Install `oh-my-zsh` and p10k. Use `p10k configure` to setup p10k. For future changes, edit `~/.p10k.zsh`
* Install fzf as well, cause why not? Refer: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#using-git
